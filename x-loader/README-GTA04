This X-loader has been modified for the http://www.GTA04.org board:

* added Micron MCP detection
* added board revision detection
* added GTA04 notice to greeting
* added memory write check when loading u-boot.bin
  from SD card to detect SDRAM failures
* added more Macros to compile either x-loader, MLO and
  serial loader from the same sources

For compiling the different variants, modify these files

1. X-Loader
a) include/configs/omap3530gta04.h 
//#define CONFIG_MMC 1
#define CONFIG_NAND 1

b) board/omap3530gta04/config.mk
TEXT_BASE = 0x40200800

2. MLO
a) include/configs/omap3530gta04.h 
#define CONFIG_MMC 1
#define CONFIG_NAND 1

b) board/omap3530gta04/config.mk
TEXT_BASE = 0x40200800

3. Serial Loader
a) include/configs/omap3530gta04.h 
//#define CONFIG_MMC 1
//#define CONFIG_NAND 1

b) board/omap3530gta04/config.mk
TEXT_BASE = 0x40200800


Compile:
make omap3530gta04_config


Result file:
X-Loader:	x-load.bin.ift
MLO:		rename x-load.bin.ift to MLO
Serial Loader:	send x-load.bin through pserial tool
